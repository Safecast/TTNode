Johan, before I waste a lot of time doing something the wrong way, can you just look at this and validate what YOU believe I should be doing here to save and restore state for successful reconnect to TTN gateway/network?

I am looking at this, which Jon pointed me to:  http://www.microchip.com/forums/m945840.aspx#951895

Today, my connect sequence looks like this:
0. sys get ver (repeatedly if necessary, to verify module connectivity)
1. foo := sys get hweui
2. mac set deveui <foo>
3. mac set appeui <my-appEui>
4. mac set appkey <my-appKey>
5. [a ton of frequency plan commands for the region]
6. mac set adr off
7. mac join otaa [potentially retrying several times until 'accepted']

Now, I'm looking at my code to restructure so that
- I change my init sequence if/as necessary to prepare for later restore
- I send something just before I powerdown the module
- I send something as an alternate init sequence just after I power up the module
