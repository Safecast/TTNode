Debugging DFU erase issue.

The issue appears to be a flow control issue, perhaps fleshing out a bug in one of
- serial.c
- app_uart_fifo.c
- app_fifo.c

The good news is that there is now odd behavior not only with the erase issue, but also during init when in the "wait:" when stuff freezes.

Step 1 should be to understand and fix the "wait:" bug.  They may not be the same.
- It could be that the flow control commands are simply not getting to the fona, and so
the fona is just getting confused in whether it's ok to send.
- But we keep getting into a state where the lights ARE flashing, indicating that the
stuff is getting to the serial handler, but nothing is coming out to the serial
- Then somehow at the end of the wait, the last buffer is flushed, and everything resumes.
- Hook a logic analyzer up and see what is happening.

After that is found/fixed, if it doesn't fix the erase bug, use GPIOs on some spare pin
to put stuff into app_uart_fifo and app_fifo just to see what is really happening
at a low level.
